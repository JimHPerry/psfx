# What is ‘Peri’s Sound Effects’ (PSFX)

PSFX is a free sound effect module for Foundry VTT. It contains a growing library of homemade, custom and animation-synchronised SFX audio files, in .ogg format.

# Who is Peri?

That’s me! I’m a friend of the creators of JB2A, a user of their assets, and a GM for one of the campaigns we play together. I wanted to add some custom, homemade SFX to the awesome animations they make, so, with their help, I started this module.

# Why make this module?

In my experience, the quality and availability of SFX pales in comparison to what is available for VFX. When I cast firebolt, I want to hear the whoosh of the flames, the smash of the impact, and the crackling of the afterburn – and I want to hear a sound that reflects the animation I see on the screen!

I also just really enjoy making sounds and I am happy to share what I do. It would be great if people could give me suggestions and feedback! 

# What is the goal of this module?

Over time, I would like to build up the module with enough assets and macros to support a range of game systems on Foundry VTT. I would like to create multiple variations of SFX for every spell, weapon and effect that can be animated so that we can all have the audio experience we deserve.

# Why make a Discord server for this module?

I want to make a special place where I can share my passion with others who can use my sounds for their games and give me inspiration and feedback on the module.  This module is not affiliated with JB2A, so I created a separate server to talk about and share SFX.

# Which other modules do I need?

That is entirely up to you! I use [JB2A (Patreon)](https://jb2a.com/) | [support JB2A](https://www.patreon.com/posts/56246490) , [Sequencer](https://fantasycomputer.works/FoundryVTT-Sequencer/#/) | [support Sequencer](https://ko-fi.com/fantasycomputerworks)  and Automated Animations to implement PSFX into my game. Follow the 'support' links to support their incredible work.

# What kind of sounds are (and will be) on this module?

Weapon attacks, spells and effects for the most part. I am open to ideas for sound design, so let me know if you have an animation that really needs a new SFX.

This module does not include music tracks.

# How do you make the sounds?

From scratch!

- First I choose the animation for which I want to design a sound.
- Then I do a foley recording session by using both mundane and unusual objects to make noises while I record them (e.g. snapping celery to make bone crunch sounds).
- Finally I stitch the sounds together to match the visuals of the animation, and add effects where needed.

# What equipment do you use?

For foley recording I use one or more of the following microphones:
- Zoom H2N
- Rode NTG2
- SE Electronics Z5600A

For the sound design I use the following software:
- Reaper
- Audacity
- Vital Synth

# Is PSFX for D&D5e?

I use this module in my D&D5e campaign, and have taken inspiration from that system for sound design. There is nothing stopping you using them for other systems though, you can mix and match from PSFX with whichever animations, in whichever game system, you see fit!

# How much does the module cost to use?

Nothing. It’s free. However, if you would like to support me you can [tip me or subscribe to my Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/perisfx) to get an awesome server role.

# How often will there be updates/releases of new sounds?

As often as I can. For context, I have a full-time day job, a family with two children and two D&D campaigns, so I use my free time around that to work on the module. I aim to add new sounds once a month, at the very least.
